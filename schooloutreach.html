     <P> “STEM pathways for foster students”
The EWB foundation worked along with the pyjama foundation  in order to bring EWB volunteers from Queensland university of Technology to tech STEM to a group of foster children. This an important project as there are currently over 50,000 children living in foster care in Australia who are facing many hardships due to their circumstances that effect their study and overall academic performance this can be seen in the NAPLAN results which show that these children are the lowest performing group.  </P>
