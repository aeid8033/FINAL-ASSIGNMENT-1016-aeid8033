           The university chapters are centred around a learning institution, an organisation or a geographic area, and extends EWB’s presence beyond the staff team. Chapters provide a framework for all types of engineers  . They can have participants who are currently studying all the way to being retired .University chapters are a great way to learn more about human -centred engineering which is something that we aim to share through this organisation.
